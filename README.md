# hello-world

Hello world! I am SuprSape, a self taught programmer that is aspiring to become an expert in the Computer Science field. Success to me is having the ability to create any piece of software I can think of just because I need it. I will soon be saying goodbye to the days where I use other people's software. Only we truly know how secure software is if we built it ourselves.
